# Classmate's Perlin Noise Terrain Creative Coding Challenge
Contains my refactored version of my classmate's Perlin Noise Terrain coding challenge. To view clicker [here](https://ellaliuu.github.io/Classmate-Perlin/perlin/)

My classmate's coding session was based off Professor Dan Shiffman's [Coding Challenge #11: 3D Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise in Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB1hWWedMk)

**What I did to refactor the program:**
* Changed the fill color and background to make it look more like real mountains instead of drawing it as a mesh
* Changed the rotation amount to make it seem like we are flying into the mountains rather than over them
* Changed the speed at which we were "flying" to make it go faster
